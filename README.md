# PacmanAI
University project in the filed of Intelligent Multi-agent Systems

This is an implementation of artifical intelligence used by the agents in the game in order to make a decision what to do in every situation. We want our agents to behave optimally, i.e. to make sound and useful decisions as to where to go in our world. In order to achieve that we use well defined and known functions such as Bellman-Ford value iteration and A* search algorithm to calculate the value of each state.
